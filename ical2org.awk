#!/usr/bin/env -S gawk -f
# awk script for converting an iCal formatted file to a sequence of org-mode headings.
# this may not work in general but seems to work for day and timed events from Google's
# calendar, which is really all I need right now...
#
# usage:
#   awk -f THISFILE < icalinputfile.ics > orgmodeentries.org
#
# Note: change org meta information generated below for author and
# email entries!
#
# Caveats:
#
# - date entries with no time specified are assumed to be local time zone;
#   same remark for date entries that do have a time but do not end with Z
#   e.g.: 20130101T123456 is local and will be kept as 2013-01-01 12:34
#   where 20130223T123422Z is UTC and will be corrected appropriately
#
# - UTC times are changed into local times, using the time zone of the
#   computer that runs the script; it would be very hard in an awk script
#   to respect the time zone of a file belonging to another time zone:
#   the offsets will be different as well as the switchover time(s);
#   (consider a remote shell to a computer with the file's time zone)
#
# - the UTC conversion entirely relies on the built-in strftime method;
#   the author is not responsible for any erroneous conversions nor the
#   consequence of such conversions
#
# - does process RRULE recurring events, but ignores COUNT specifiers
#
# - does not process EXDATE to exclude date(s) from recurring events
#
# Eric S Fraga
# 20100629 - initial version
# 20100708 - added end times to timed events
#          - adjust times according to time zone information
#          - fixed incorrect transfer for entries with ":" embedded within the text
#          - added support for multi-line summary entries (which become headlines)
# 20100709 - incorporated time zone identification
#          - fixed processing of continuation lines as Google seems to
#            have changed, in the last day, the number of spaces at
#            the start of the line for each continuation...
#          - remove backslashes used to protect commas in iCal text entries
# no further revision log after this as the file was moved into a git
# repository...
